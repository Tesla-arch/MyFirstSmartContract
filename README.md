A search for remix ide, and was directed to multiple search results where I selected the first link(https://remix.ethereum.org/)


Step 2
Selected workspaces from the opened window and created a new workspace named MyFirstSmartContract


Step 3
Proceeded to create a new file with the name SimpleStorage.sol with respect to the given assignment

step 4
Specifies the MIT Licensing and the Fragma version of the compiler, followed by creating my first smart contract named SimpleStorage which only declares a public unit variable named favouriteNumber.(NB: I also made refereces from the learning page for this part)

step 5
Proceeded to the compiler tab where I vividly make sure my stated compiler matches with the solidity compiler for the contract. (^0.8.25) in this case.

step 6
From the Deploy tab, I specifies the Remix VM(cacum) as my environment from which I proceed to deploy the contract
